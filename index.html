        <p class="intro">
            Dogs are social pack animals who thrive off of attention and affection, 
            making them a prime candidate for a person's best friend. 
            Since dogs have been domesticated to a point where they need us to survive, 
            and we tend to find that we need them almost as much, 
            people and dogs developed a symbiotic relationship.

            <h1>Dogs Are Not Only Amazing Pets</h1>

            <p>Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, 
                protection, assisting police and the military, companionship and aiding 
                disabled individuals.</p>

            <p>People often enter their dogs in competitions, such as breed-conformation shows 
                or sports, including racing, sledding and agility competitions. In conformation 
                shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog 
                breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established 
                breed type as described in the breed standard.</p>

            <p>Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, 
                alertness, and love. In China, Korea and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.
                In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs. In Christianity, dogs represent 
                faithfulness. The view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it 
                as unclean, however, they are widely accepted to perform their role as pets.</p>
